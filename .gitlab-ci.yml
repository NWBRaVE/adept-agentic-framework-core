# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages
#
# You can copy and paste this template into a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
# You should not add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:` keyword.

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - static-analysis
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# static-analysis
# This job uses 'Ruff' to perform fast linting, import sorting, and format checking.
# Ruff can replace tools like flake8, isort, and black.
# Docs: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/
lint-and-format-check:
  stage: static-analysis
  image: python:3.11-slim
  before_script:
    - pip install ruff
  script:
    - echo "🔍 Running ruff linter (for syntax, imports, etc.)..."
    - ruff check .
    - echo "🎨 Running ruff format checker..."
    - ruff format --check .

# This job uses 'TruffleHog' to scan the repository for any hardcoded secrets.
# This is crucial for preventing sensitive data like API keys from being exposed.
# Docs: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog
secret-detection:
  stage: static-analysis
  # Use the official TruffleHog image. The entrypoint is overridden to run custom commands.
  image:
    name: trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - echo "🔑 Scanning for secrets..."
    # Scans the entire project directory. The '--fail' flag ensures the pipeline
    # fails if any potential secrets are found.
    - trufflehog filesystem . --fail


build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compile complete."

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found."

deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  environment: production
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
