This chapter enhances the ADEPT framework by introducing a dedicated MCP server for [High-Performance Computing (HPC)](#references) tasks and upgrading the agent to use [LangGraph](#references) for more sophisticated [Chain-of-Thought (CoT)](#references) reasoning.

## Key Additions

- **HPC MCP Server**: A new, separate `fastmcp` server is added to host computationally intensive tools like [Nextflow](#references) pipelines for [BLAST](#references) searches, video processing with [Whisper](#references), and code repository security scanning with [GitXRay](#references). This separation of concerns prevents long-running tasks from blocking the main MCP server. The server is built with [FastAPI](#references) and run with [Uvicorn](#references).
- **LangGraph Integration**: The agent is upgraded from a simple agent to a more complex reasoning engine built with [LangGraph](#references) and [LangChain](#references). This allows for more explicit and controllable multi-step reasoning, which is a more advanced form of [Chain-of-Thought](#references). The agent can now create more complex plans and execute them.
- **Stateful Interactions**: The use of `mcp_session_id` is continued and becomes more important for tracking the state of these more complex, multi-step workflows. We use [ChromaDB](#references) for session state management.

## Technologies Used

This chapter utilizes several key technologies:

- **[FastAPI](#references)**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **[Uvicorn](#references)**: A lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, used to run FastAPI applications.
- **[LangGraph](#references)**: A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of LangChain.
- **[LangChain](#references)**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- **[Nextflow](#references)**: A workflow system for creating scalable and reproducible scientific workflows.
- **[NCBI BLAST](#references)**: A program for comparing primary biological sequence information.
- **[OpenAI Whisper](#references)**: A general-purpose speech recognition model.
- **[yt-dlp](#references)**: A command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other video sites.
- **[LiteLLM](#references)**: A library to simplify LLM completion and embedding calls.
- **[ChromaDB](#references)**: An open-source embedding database.
- **[Pydantic](#references)**: A data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations.
- **[Docker](#references)**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **[AlphaFold EBI](#references)**: A database of protein structure predictions.
- **[PubChemPy](#references)**: A Python wrapper for the PubChem PUG REST API.
- **[UniProt](#references)**: A comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data.
- **[Biopython](#references)**: A set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python.
- **[GitXRay](#references)**: A security tool for GitHub repositories.

### How It Works: HPC and Advanced Reasoning

This chapter introduces two major advancements:

**Example User Query:** "Please transcribe the video at `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example` and give me the key takeaways."

1.  **HPC MCP Server**: A second, specialized MCP server is introduced to handle long-running, computationally intensive tasks. When the agent receives the user's query, it selects the `RunVideoTranscriptionPipelineHPC` tool. The request is routed to the dedicated HPC server, which then orchestrates a Nextflow pipeline to download, transcribe, and summarize the video, finally returning the summary to the user.

2.  **LangGraph for Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: The agent's reasoning process is upgraded to use LangGraph. This allows the agent to create and execute complex, multi-step plans, giving it a more robust Chain-of-Thought capability. For example, if the user asked to first transcribe a video and then run a BLAST search on a sequence mentioned in the transcript, the agent would create a two-step plan and execute it in the correct order.
