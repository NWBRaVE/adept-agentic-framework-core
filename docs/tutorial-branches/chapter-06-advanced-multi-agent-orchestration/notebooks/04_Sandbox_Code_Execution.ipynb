    "# 04: Sandbox Code Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases the `sandbox_mcp_server`, which provides a secure and isolated environment for executing arbitrary code. This allows the agent to perform dynamic calculations, data manipulation, and other tasks that can be solved with code, without compromising the host system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure that the Docker services for Chapter 06 are up and running. You can start them by navigating to the `chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration` directory and executing the lifecycle script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./start-chapter-resources.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, ensure you have an SSH session with port forwarding for OpenWebUI (`8902`), the Agent Gateway (`8083`), and the Sandbox MCP server (`8082`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -L 8902:localhost:8902 -L 8083:localhost:8083 -L 8082:localhost:8082 user@remote-server\n",

    "## 1. Executing Python Code\n",

    "The `ExecuteCode` tool allows you to run Python code within the sandbox. The sandbox is isolated and has no network access, making it safe for executing untrusted code. The last line of the code should be an expression that yields the result.\n"

    "The `ExecuteCode` tool can also capture and return plots generated by Python libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`. To enable this, set the `generate_plot` parameter to `True`. Remember to explicitly create figure objects (e.g., `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`) and avoid `plt.show()`. The figure object should be the last expression in your code block for it to be captured.\n",
