    "# 05: Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the advanced multi-agent orchestration capabilities of the Agentic Framework. It demonstrates two distinct modes for orchestrating agent workflows: a static, plan-based approach (Router Mode with \"Plan and Review\") and a dynamic, graph-based system (Graph Mode with Loop Prevention).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure that the Docker services for Chapter 06 are up and running. You can start them by navigating to the `chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration` directory and executing the lifecycle script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./start-chapter-resources.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, ensure you have an SSH session with port forwarding for OpenWebUI (`8902`), the Agent Gateway (`8083`), and the main MCP server (`8080`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -L 8902:localhost:8902 -L 8083:localhost:8083 -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote-server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Router Mode - Collaborative \"Plan and Review\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario demonstrates the new, more robust \"Plan and Review\" workflow in 'router' mode. In this mode, the agent team will collaboratively review and refine a plan before it is presented to the user for approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a Multi-Agent Session\n",

    "We will create a multi-agent session in 'router' mode with specific roles for the worker agents.\n"
