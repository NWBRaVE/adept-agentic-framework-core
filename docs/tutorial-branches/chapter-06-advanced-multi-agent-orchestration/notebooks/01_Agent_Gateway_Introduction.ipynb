    "# 01: Agent Gateway Introduction
",
    "
",
    "This notebook introduces the Agent Gateway, a central component in the Agentic Framework that provides a unified, OpenAI-compatible entry point for all agent interactions. It manages tool registration, authentication, and authorization, and dynamically provisions the `ScientificWorkflowAgent` with the appropriate tools for each user session.
",
    "
",
    "## Getting Started
",
    "
",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure that the Docker services for Chapter 06 are up and running. You can start them by navigating to the `chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration` directory and executing the lifecycle script:
",
    "
",
    "```bash
",
    "./start-chapter-resources.sh
",
    "```
",
    "
",
    "Also, ensure you have an SSH session with port forwarding for both OpenWebUI (`8902`) and the Agent Gateway (`8083`):
",
    "
",
    "```bash
",
    "ssh -L 8902:localhost:8902 -L 8083:localhost:8083 user@remote-server
",
    "```
",
    "
",
    "## 1. Discovering Available Models
",
    "
",
    "The Agent Gateway exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint that allows clients to discover the available agent configurations. We can query this endpoint using `curl` or Python's `requests` library.
",
    "
",
    "### Using `curl`
",
    "
",
    "Open a **new local terminal** (not your SSH session) and run the following `curl` command:
",
    "
",
    "```bash
",
    "curl http://localhost:8083/v1/models | jq
",
    "```
",
    "
",
    "You should see a JSON output similar to this:
",
    "
",
    "```json
",
    "{

    "  "object": "list",
",

",
    "}
",
    "```
",
    "
",
    "### Using Python `requests`
",
    "
",
    "You can also use the `requests` library in Python to achieve the same result. This is useful for programmatic interaction with the gateway.

    "## 2. Discovering Tools for a Specific Model
",
    "
",
    "The Agent Gateway also provides a custom endpoint (`/tools/{model_id}`) to discover the tools available to a specific agent model. This is particularly useful for understanding the capabilities of an agent before interacting with it.
",

",

",

    "## 3. Interacting with the Agent via OpenAI-Compatible API
",
    "
",
    "The primary way to interact with the `ScientificWorkflowAgent` through the Agent Gateway is via its OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This allows you to use standard OpenAI client libraries.
",
    "
",
    "### Using Python `openai` library
",
    "
",
    "First, ensure you have the `openai` library installed (`pip install openai`). Then, you can use the following code to send a chat message to the agent.

",

",
    "AGENT_GATEWAY_URL = "http://localhost:8083/v1"
",
