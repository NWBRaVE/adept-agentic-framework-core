    "# 02: Dynamic Tool Registration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a hands-on guide to dynamically registering tools with the Agent Gateway. The Agent Gateway allows you to extend the `ScientificWorkflowAgent`'s capabilities at runtime without restarting any services. We will cover registering and using various tool types:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Simple `stdio` scripts\n",
    "*   Containerized `stdio` tools\n",
    "*   The universal `docker mcp gateway run` adapter\n",
    "*   HTTP-based tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure that the Docker services for Chapter 06 are up and running. You can start them by navigating to the `chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration` directory and executing the lifecycle script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./start-chapter-resources.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, ensure you have an SSH session with port forwarding for both OpenWebUI (`8902`) and the Agent Gateway (`8083`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -L 8902:localhost:8902 -L 8083:localhost:8083 user@remote-server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Dynamically Registering a `stdio` Tool (Python Script)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will register a simple Python script (`sys_info_tool.py`) as a `stdio` tool. This script reads JSON from `stdin` and writes its result as JSON to `stdout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Review the Tool's Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sys_info_tool.py` script is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/tools/sys_info_tool.py`. It retrieves basic system information from the container it's running in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Review the Tool's JSON Registration File\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON file (`stdio_sys_info_tool.json`) describes our new tool to the Agent Gateway. It specifies the tool's name, description, arguments schema, and how to invoke it (`stdio` protocol with a `command`). This file is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/config/stdio_sys_info_tool.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Register the New Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "We will send the JSON configuration to the running `agent_gateway`'s `/v1/tools/register` endpoint using `curl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a **new local terminal** (not your SSH session) and run the following `curl` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1/tools/register \\\n",
    "-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "-d @docs/tutorial-branches/chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration/src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/stdio_sys_info_tool.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a success message like: `{\"status\":\"success\",\"message\":\"Tool 'get_system_information' registered successfully...\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Verify the Registration\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's verify that the Agent Gateway recognizes the new tool by querying the `/tools/{model_id}` endpoint.\n"

    "### Step 5: Use the New Tool in a Chat Session\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can interact with the agent via OpenWebUI and ask it to use the newly registered tool. Go to OpenWebUI at `http://localhost:8902` and start a new chat. Ask the agent a question that would cause it to use your new tool, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`What is the system information of the server you are running on?`\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent should respond with details about the operating system, architecture, Python version, and container hostname.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Progressing to a Containerized `stdio` Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The true power of the `stdio` protocol is its flexibility. The gateway doesn't care *what* it runs, only that it can execute the command and communicate via stdin/stdout. We can demonstrate this by packaging our simple Python script into its own standalone Docker container and registering it as a new tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Review the Dockerfile for the Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dockerfile.sys_info_tool` is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/tools/Dockerfile.sys_info_tool`. It packages the `sys_info_tool.py` script into a Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Build the Docker Image\n",
    "\n",
    "On your **remote server** (via your SSH session), build the Docker image for the tool. This command must be run from the root of the `agentic_framework` project directory (e.g., `/Users/rigo160/Documents-Local/LocalWorkspace/MCP-Tool-Framework-v8-2025-06-03/agentic_framework/`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build -t sys-info-tool:latest -f docs/tutorial-branches/chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration/src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/tools/Dockerfile.sys_info_tool docs/tutorial-branches/chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration/src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/tools/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Review the New JSON Registration File\n",
    "\n",
    "The `stdio_sys_info_tool_docker.json` file is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/stdio_sys_info_tool_docker.json`. The only significant change from the previous registration file is the `command` field, which now points to `docker run`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"get_system_information_docker\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"A DOCKERIZED tool that retrieves basic system information from its own container, such as OS type and architecture.\",\n",
    "  \"args_schema\": {},\n",
    "  \"invocation\": {\n",
    "    \"protocol\": \"stdio\",\n",
    "    \"connection\": {\n",
    "      \"command\": [\n",
    "        \"docker\",\n",
    "        \"run\",\n",
    "        \"--rm\",\n",
    "        \"-i\",\n",
    "        \"sys-info-tool:latest\"\n",
    "      ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"acl\": {\n",
    "    \"global\": true\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Register and Use the Dockerized Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Register the new tool using `curl` from your **local terminal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1/tools/register \\\n",
    "-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "-d @docs/tutorial-branches/chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration/src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/stdio_sys_info_tool_docker.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify its registration using the Python code from Section 1, but search for `get_system_information_docker`. Then, in OpenWebUI, ask the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Use the DOCKERIZED tool to get the system information.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will now invoke the `docker run` command, and you will get the system information from the ephemeral `sys-info-tool` container.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Using the `docker mcp gateway run` Universal Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the most advanced and decoupled method for tool invocation: using a universal adapter for the `docker mcp gateway run` command. This pattern provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to add and modify underlying tools without ever changing the registration data in the `agent_gateway`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Review the Gateway Adapter Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gateway_run_adapter.py` script is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/tools/gateway_run_adapter.py`. This simple Python script acts as a bridge: the `agent_gateway` will execute this script, which in turn executes the `docker mcp gateway run` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Review the Universal Tool Registration File\n",
    "\n",
    "The `stdio_docker_mcp_gateway_run_example.json` file is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/stdio_docker_mcp_gateway_run_example.json`. This file registers our universal adapter. Notice the `args_schema` fields: `mcp_tool_name` (the name of the *actual* tool to run) and `mcp_tool_args` (the arguments for that tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Register the Universal Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your local, port-forwarded terminal, register this new universal tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1/tools/register \\\n",
    "-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "-d @docs/tutorial-branches/chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration/src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/stdio_docker_mcp_gateway_run_example.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Use the Universal Adapter in a Chat Session\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can invoke *any* tool known to the `docker mcp` environment through this single, unified interface. Go to OpenWebUI and ask the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Use the invoke_mcp_gateway_tool to run the get_system_information tool with no arguments.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will call `invoke_mcp_gateway_tool`, providing `mcp_tool_name=\"get_system_information\"` and `mcp_tool_args={}`. The `agent_gateway` runs the adapter script, which then executes `docker mcp gateway run get_system_information`. The result is passed back to the agent, which formulates the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Registering and Using an HTTP-Based Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This section showcases how to register a tool that communicates with an external service over HTTP, allowing the agent to interact with existing microservices or public APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Review the HTTP Tool Registration File\n",
    "\n",
    "The `http_tool_example.json` file is located at `src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/http_tool_example.json`. It defines a hypothetical `get_weather_conditions` tool that makes an HTTP `GET` request to `https://api.example.com/weather/current`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Register the HTTP Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "In your **local terminal** (with the SSH port forward active), run the `curl` command to register the tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/v1/tools/register \\\n",
    "-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "-d @docs/tutorial-branches/chapter-06-advanced-multi-agent-orchestration/src/agentic_framework_pkg/agent_gateway/cli/examples/http_tool_example.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Verify and Use the Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify its registration using the Python code from Section 1, but search for `get_weather_conditions`. Then, in OpenWebUI, ask the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "`What is the weather like in Seattle?`\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will call the tool. While this specific example will fail (as the API is hypothetical), it demonstrates the mechanism for integrating real-world APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the dynamic tool registration tutorial. In the next notebook, we will explore the `ScientificWorkflowAgent`'s RAG capabilities.\n"
